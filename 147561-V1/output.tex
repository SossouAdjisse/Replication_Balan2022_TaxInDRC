\parbox{6in}{\footnotesize \textit{Notes}: N = number of observations, J = number of clusters (neighborhoods). The property register has more observations per neighborhood than the midline survey because the former includes information on all compounds, including (exempt) government buildings, churches, and empty lots, while the midline survey was only conducted with privately owned plots liable for the property tax. The primary tax outcomes result from merging official property tax records with data from the property register. The mechanics of the tax campaign and data sources are discussed, respectively, in Sections \ref{mechanics} and \ref{data}.}

\parbox{6in}{\footnotesize \textit{Notes}: This table shows the numbers of neighborhoods (clusters) and properties assigned to each treatment arm. In Central, state agents hired by the provincial tax ministry collected property taxes, while in Local, neighborhood chiefs collected. CLI is short for Central + Local Information, a treatment arm in which tax ministry agents consulted with chiefs before making tax visits. In CXL, or Central X Local, one agent of the tax ministry and one chief worked together on the campaign. In Control, citizens received tax letters informing them of their responsibility to pay at the tax ministry (rather than paying to collectors), as was the status quo declarative system in Kananga until 2016. We discuss these treatments in Section \ref{treatment_arms}. We also discuss the reason for differential allocation of clusters across treatment arms in Section \ref{different_allocation}.}

Panel D shows differences in attrition from baseline to endline surveying, replacement at endline of baseline respondents, and attrition from registration to midline surveying. The Central arm is the omitted category, and Pure Control neighborhoods are excluded. Superscripts $B$, $M$, and $R$ denote variables from baseline, midline, and registration, respectively.

The two panels show estimates from separate regressions of compliance and revenues (in Congolese Francs) on treatment, respectively. All regressions include fixed effects for randomization strata and cluster standard errors at the neighborhood level. Column 1 regressions do not include time period fixed effects described in Section \ref{estimation} while those in other columns include them. Regressions in Columns 1--3 do not include house fixed effects. Column 3 shows results when the data are collapsed to the neighborhood level. We use robust standard errors and assign the minimum value for time period fixed effects to a neighborhood. Regressions in Column 4 exclude exempt properties. The data include all properties registered by tax collectors merged with the government's property tax database. We discuss these results in Section \ref{results_discussion}.}

\centering
\input{Output/assessment_bribes.tex}
\input{Output/attitudes.tex}
\usebox{\tablebox}\\[1ex]
\parbox{6in}{\footnotesize \textit{Notes}: Each row summarizes an OLS estimation of Equation \ref{equation_cvl}, comparing Local and Central, with the dependent variable noted in the first column. $\hat{\beta}$ is the coefficient on the treatment indicator, followed by the cluster-robust standard error, $R^2$, number of observations, and $\bar{x}_{Central}$ the Central group mean. In Panel A, row 1 shows differences in whether the collector designated the property exempt from taxes. Properties owned by the elderly, widows, government pensioners, and handicapped individuals, among others, are legally supposed to be exempt. Row 2 shows differences in whether an independent enumerator disagreed (in either direction) with the exemption status of a given property. Row 3 shows differences in whether a property was assigned to the high-value category, and row 4 shows whether enumerators' independent evaluations diverged with the collectors' designation. In Panel B, the outcomes in rows 5 and 7 are self-reported bribe payment as measured during the midline and endline surveys, respectively. The outcome in row 6 indicates property owners who reported paying the tax but who were not recorded as having paid in the administrative data. The outcome in row 8 is self-reported payment of any informal fees at endline. We discuss the results from Panels A and B in Section \ref{assessments}. In Panels C and D, for endline outcomes we also measured at baseline --- all variables except for \textit{Perceived tax compliance} and \textit{Fairness of property taxation} --- we control for the baseline value. Each dependent variable, described briefly in Section \ref{survey_variables} and in detail in Section \ref{variable_descriptions}, is standardized to facilitate interpretation of coefficient magnitude.  We discuss the results in Panels C and D in Section \ref{attitudes_discussion}. In all panels, regressions include fixed effects for randomization strata, and cluster standard errors at the neighborhood level. Regressions estimating effects on midline and property assessment outcomes include time period fixed effects described in Section \ref{estimation} and house type fixed effects. We do not include house type fixed effects for endline outcomes to maximize the analysis sample, as discussed in Section \ref{estimation}. The number of observations varies across regressions due to (\textit{i}) outcomes being drawn from different surveys, and (\textit{ii}) non-response for specific survey questions. }

All regressions include fixed effects for house type, randomization strata, and time periods described in Section \ref{estimation}, and cluster standard errors at the neighborhood level. Columns 1 and 2 report differences in tax visits by --- after the registration visit --- by the extensive and intensive margins, respectively. Columns 3 and 4 report differences in citizen-reported other contact with collectors outside of the tax campaign, by the intensive and extensive margins, respectively.

Columns 1, 5, and 6 report impacts on compliance. Column 2 reports impacts on revenues. Columns 3 and 4 report differences in tax visits by collectors after registration by the extensive and intensive margins, respectively. All regressions include fixed effects for house type,  randomization strata, and time periods and cluster standard errors at the neighborhood level. All specifications include time fixed effects defined to maximize overlap between the treatments under comparison, as discussed in Section \ref{estimation}. Column 5 restricts to the subsample of properties that received any tax visits after registration. Column 6 includes a dummy for the Local treatment in the regression.

Columns 1, 3, 6, and 8 show correlations between propensity and tax visits; Columns 2, 4, 5, 7, and 9 show correlations between propensity and compliance. Column 5 shows correlations with compliance conditional on receiving a visit after registration. All regressions include house type and randomization stratum fixed effects and cluster standard errors at the neighborhood level. Columns 3, 4, and 6--8 include controls for visible household characteristics. We show results excluding house fixed effects in Table \ref{validation_cli_control_NoHouseFE}.

\parbox{6in}{\footnotesize \textit{Notes}: This figure reports differences by treatment arm in the characteristics of properties visited by collectors after registration, showing differences in characteristics of visited properties in the Local and CLI arms relative to the Central arm.  Panel A shows differences in visible and non-visible characteristics for indices described in Section \ref{targeting_discussion}.  Panel B shows differences in the probability of receiving a visit in the four cells indicated (defined by interactions of high/low dummies for household house quality and predicted ease of payment). Differences are estimated through separate regressions of characteristics on a treatment indicator among visited properties, controlling for the leave-one-out neighborhood mean of the outcome (Panel A) or the neighborhood mean of house quality and ease of payment (Panel B). We include time period, house type, and stratum fixed effects. We cluster standard errors at the neighborhood level. Households that paid during registration are dropped. As a comparison, Figure \ref{main_targeting_appendix} shows the correlations between tax visits and household characteristics within treatments, rather than differences across treatments. Figures \ref{fig:main_targeting1_NoHouseFE} and \ref{main_targeting_noControlMean_appendix} replicate this analysis while omitting house fixed effects and neighborhood mean controls, respectively. We discuss these results in Section \ref{targeting_discussion}.}

\usebox{\tablebox}\\[1ex]
\parbox{6in}{\footnotesize \textit{Notes}: This table reports estimates from a version of Equation \ref{equation_cvl}, comparing property tax compliance in Local and Central (the excluded category). We include fixed effects for house type, randomization strata, and time periods, as described in Section \ref{estimation}, and we cluster standard errors at the neighborhood level. Columns 1 and 2 report estimates of the impact of local collection on compliance for low- and high-band households, respectively. Column 3 reports differences in an index of house quality conditional on the property paying the tax.  Column 4 reports differences in monthly household income of properties, averaged across baseline and endline values, in Congolese Francs, conditional on paying the tax.  Column 5 reports differences in an index of liquidity measures drawn from baseline (excepting income, which is also included, and uses information from endline) among payers. Columns 3--5 control for the leave-one-out neighborhood mean of the outcome. For robustness, we re-estimate these results excluding (\textit{i}) property type fixed effects (Table \ref{Table_CvL_Distribution_Incidence_NoHouseFE}) and (\textit{ii}) leave-one-out neighborhood mean controls (Table \ref{Table_CvLvCLI_Distribution_Incidence}). We also estimate (\textit{iii}) an interacted version of the house type regressions in Columns 1--2 (Table \ref{PaperTable_CvL_Incidence_HouseTypeInteraction}) and (\textit{iv}) an alternative version of Columns 3--5 in tax compliance is regressed on indicators for having complier characteristics above the median value in the sample are interacted, a Local treatment indicator, and the interaction (Table \ref{PaperTable_CvL_Incidence_Cols3to5Interactions}). Figure \ref{fig:distribution_all} (Panel B) shows the distribution of house quality among tax compliers across treatments. We discuss the interpretation of these results in Section \ref{incidence_discussion}.}

\parbox{6in}{\footnotesize \textit{Notes}: This figure displays a sample tax notice, which is discussed in Section \ref{mechanics}. The flier says: ``For the 2018 property tax collection campaign: the compound 697051 belonging to [name of owner] is subject to a tax rate of 3000 CF to be paid to a DGRKOC collector once per year. As proof of payment, you will receive a receipt printed on the spot (see example to the right). It is important to pay the property tax.'' The footnote says ``Other amounts apply if you live in a house built of durable materials.'' This flier contains the Control message (``It is important to pay the property tax''), discussed in the text in Section \ref{persuasion} and in detail in Section \ref{information_treatments}. A version of the flier in Tshiluba, the primary local language, was printed on the opposite side. Fliers were identical across treatment arms.}

Column 3 reports a simple difference-in-means test. The data come from surveys conducted with tax collectors before the 2018 campaign. The first seven variables are the respondent's age, a sex indicator, an indicator for being born in Kananga, log monthly income, wealth (defined as the number of possessions: motorbike, car, radio, TV, generator and sewing machine), years of education, and an indicator for working another job during the tax campaign. \textit{Math Ability} and \textit{Reading Ability} are collectors' average score on a series of quiz-type questions. The last four measures concern attitudes about the government and redistribution, measured through survey questions with Likert-scale response options. These comparisons are discussed in Section \ref{treatment_arms}.}

The specifications follow \cite{miguel2004} in controlling for the number of adjacent neighborhoods in different treatments (as well as the total number of adjacent neighborhoods). We evaluate two definitions of alternate treatments: the ``strict'' version codes adjacent neighborhoods as being in the alternate treatment if in Central (for a Local neighborhood) or Local (for a Central neighborhood); the ``broad'' version codes this as Central, CLI, or CXL (if Local) and Local or CXL (if Central). Due to campaign staggering across neighborhoods, we only consider exposure to treatments in adjacent neighborhoods in which collectors had already worked or were currently working, rather than neighborhoods that had been assigned to a different treatment but had not yet received tax collectors. Columns 1 and 3 report estimates of the impact of Local, controlling for the number of adjacent neighborhoods in the alternate treatment arm and total adjacent neighborhoods, for the strict and broad definitions, respectively. Columns 2 and 4 report estimates of the impact of Local collection with an interaction term for the number of adjacent neighborhoods assigned to the alternate treatment arm, controlling for the total number of adjacent neighborhoods, for strict and broad, respectively.

\parbox{6.3in}{\footnotesize{\textit{Notes}: This table provides evidence on the counterfactual of the increase in bribes in Local relative to Central. Specifically, it shows correlations between predicted chief bribe payment and tax and bribe payments in the Central treatment arm. Predicted bribe payment is constructed by regressing bribe payment (at endline) in Local on baseline household and property characteristics, retaining the variables with significant coefficients, and using these variables to predict bribe payment (at endline) in the Central treatment arm. This exercise simulates the likely bribe payers if Central neighborhoods had in fact been assigned to Local. The variables used in the final prediction exercise include: age of property owner, whether a family member of household members works for the government, whether the household possesses a radio, trust in the provincial government, whether the respondent knows the neighborhood chief, has the chief's phone number, and attends the same church as the chief. The Predicted Bribe Payer variable is an indicator for the predicted value being greater than the 75th (Panel A) or 90th percentile (Panel B). Tax compliance is measured using administrative tax data, post-registration visits using the midline survey, and bribe payment using the endline survey (our preferred measure using a local code for bribes, discussed in Section \ref{bribe_discussion}).  All regressions include fixed effects for randomization strata and cluster standard errors at the neighborhood level. Column 2 restricts the sample to households that received visits from tax collectors after registration. The number of observations for bribe outcomes is smaller than the full endline sample because this variable was only collected among households who reported at least one visit from tax collectors after property registration.

We exclude the period straddling the final month of CLI (months 5 and 7), as there are few neighborhoods assigned to the Local treatment arm in month 7.

The second row reports costs under a hypothetical system in which chief collectors were paid (and remit tax collections) via mobile money rather than visiting the tax ministry to receive bonuses (and deposit collections). Costs for Central under this alternative system would remain the same. Columns 3 and 6 show the amounts of bribes collecting according to the measure at endline, scaled by the number of individuals surveyed at endline relative to the neighborhood population of households.  All amounts are in Congolese Francs.  Column 7 reports the implied multiplier on bribe payments that would be required for the government to weakly prefer employing state collectors instead of chief collectors: $\Gamma=((R_L-R_C)-(C_L-C_C))/(B_L-B_C)$.
